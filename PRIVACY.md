# Privacy Policy for drop

**Effective Date:** September 12, 2025

Your privacy is a core principle of this application. "drop" is designed to be a private, personal tool that you control completely.

### Data Collection and Storage

This application operates entirely within your web browser. It does not have a backend server and does not collect or transmit your personal data to any external service.

All data you generate and use within the app is stored exclusively in your browser's **`localStorage`** on your device. This includes:

*   **Quarterly Commitments:** Your chosen path (Direct, Archetype, Growth) and the specific archetypes or targets you set for each domain.
*   **Daily Logs:** All daily presence data you log, such as sleep embodiment, fitness activities, reading/writing sessions, meditation instances, and burnout levels.
*   **Oura API Data:** If you choose to connect your Oura Ring, the application will fetch data (such as sleep, activity, and readiness scores) from the Oura API. This data is also stored only in your browser's `localStorage` and is never shared.

### Data Usage

Your data is used solely for the functionality of the application, which includes:

*   Displaying your daily progress and quarterly commitments.
*   Calculating weekly trends for the Gratitude and Quarterly Review screens.
*   Calculating "Growth Mode" and fitness target suggestions based on your logged history.

### Third-Party Services

#### Oura API Integration
This application reads data from the Oura API to automate sleep and activity tracking. The connection is made securely via an OAuth 2.0 flow that runs entirely in your browser.

*   The app requests **read-only** access to your sleep, activity, and readiness data.
*   The app **does not** send any personal log data (like reading, writing, or burnout) *to* Oura.
*   The fetched Oura data is subject to the same privacy principle: it is stored locally on your device and is not shared.

### Data Sharing and Transmission

**Your data is never transmitted to, stored on, or shared with any external server or third party by this application.**

### Your Control and Data Security

You have full control over your data.

*   You can view your data at any time within the application.
*   You are responsible for backing up your data using the **"Export Data"** feature, which saves a local file to your device.
*   You can delete all of your application data at any time by clearing your browser's site data or using the in-app "Reset Data" function.

This policy may be updated as the application evolves. Any changes will be reflected in this document within the project's public GitHub repository.
