# Terms of Service for drop

**Effective Date:** September 12, 2025

By using the "drop" application (the "App"), you agree to these terms.

### 1. Use of the App

This App is provided for **personal, non-commercial use only**. It is designed as a tool to help you track and reflect on your personal goals and habits.

The source code for this App is made available under the **MIT License**. You are free to view, modify, and distribute the code in accordance with the terms of that license.

### 2. Disclaimer of Warranty

The App is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes but is not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The developer makes no guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that it will meet your specific requirements.

### 3. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the developer be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the App. This includes, but is not limited to, **data loss** or data being rendered inaccurate.

### 4. User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for the data you enter into the App.

Because all data is stored locally on your device, **you are also solely responsible for maintaining backups of your data** by regularly using the built-in "Export Data" feature. Failure to do so may result in the permanent loss of your data if your browser cache is cleared or your device is lost.

### 5. Oura API Integration

The App's integration with the Oura API is provided as a convenience. Your use of the Oura API is subject to Oura's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The developer of this App is not responsible for the availability or functionality of the Oura API.

### 6. Changes to Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the project's public GitHub repository. Continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
