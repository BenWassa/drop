**low-fi UI flow** draft for your app, now that we’ve locked in:

* **Quarterly archetype commitments**
* **Target assignment styles tied to user type** (Direct = Manual, Archetypes = Semi-auto, Growth = Auto)
* **Minimal words per screen**

# 🌊 Ocean in a Drop — UI Flow

## 1. Onboarding / Quarterly Reset (Vision)

**Screen 1**

* Prompt: *“Choose your path.”*
* Options:

  1. Direct Control
  2. Archetypes
  3. Growth Mode

**Screen 2 (varies by choice)**

* **Direct Control** → manual target entry per domain (Sleep, Fitness, Mind, Spirit).
* **Archetypes** → pick identity cards (Earlybird, Perspicacity, etc.), system suggests semi-auto targets → confirm or adjust.
* **Growth Mode** → pick domains you want to attend to; system sets automatic targets.

**Screen 3 (confirmation ritual)**

* Summary card: *“You are stepping into Earlybird + Perspicacity this quarter.”*
* Confirm button → Begin.
