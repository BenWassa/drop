# 🌊 Project drop — UI Flow (Updated)

This flow integrates the latest specs from the Commissioning Doc and README.

---

## 1. Onboarding / Quarterly Reset (Vision)

**Screen 1**

* Prompt: *“Who do you want to be this quarter?”*
* Options:

  1. Direct Control (manual targets)
  2. Archetypes (semi-auto)
  3. Growth Mode (auto)

**Screen 2 (path-dependent)**

* **Direct Control** → user manually sets allocations for all domains.
* **Archetypes** → user picks identity cards (e.g. Earlybird, Perspicacity); system proposes allocations → confirm/adjust.
* **Growth Mode** → user selects domains; system sets automatic allocations from trends.

**Screen 3 (confirmation ritual)**

* Summary card: *“You are stepping into Earlybird + Perspicacity this quarter.”*
* Confirm button → Begin.

---

## 2. Presence (Daily Logging — Home)

**Top Card**

* Date + quarterly archetype reminder (e.g. *“Quarterly Mode: Earlybird”*).

**Domain Cards (swipe-scrollable)**

* **Sleep (Identity)** → shows chosen wake/sleep archetype (e.g. 6:30 / 10:30). No daily toggle; it’s a quarterly identity.
* **Fitness (Allocation)** → shows weekly allocation + mode (Maintain, Deload, Growth). Daily logging via slider/vibe.
* **Reading & Writing (Tiered)** → shows chosen archetypes + sessions/week target. Tap to log sessions.
* **Meditation (Instances)** → tap to log each meditation instance. Archetype (Awareness, Introspection, Transcendence) shown.
* **Burnout (State)** → slider 1–5 for daily state check-in.

**Interactions**

* Tap = add instance / yes.
* Swipe/drag = vibe or duration.
* Press & hold = intensity fill.

**Daily Footer Card**

* Visual summary: e.g. *“4/6 today”* with subtle animation.

---

## 3. Gratitude (Reflection & Stats)

**Weekly View**

* Direct = bar charts, streak lines.
* Archetypes = completion / resonance rings.
* Growth = ocean fill animation.
* Burnout = line graph or heatmap overlay.

**Monthly View**

* Cumulative arcs and trend patterns.

**Quarterly View**

* Archetype resonance: % embodied.
* Reflection ritual: reaffirm or adjust.

**Reflection Prompt**

* One-liner, offline: *“What deepened this week?”*

---

## 4. Rules for All Screens

* **≤15 words per screen.**
* **Colors per domain:** Sleep = blue, Fitness = red, Mind = yellow, Spirit = green.
* **Graphics-first UI:** bars, rings, waves, fills.
* **One action per card:** tap, swipe, or hold.
* **Feedback:** glow, ripple, wave animations (no heavy text).
* **Mobile-first, dark mode, large tap targets.**
