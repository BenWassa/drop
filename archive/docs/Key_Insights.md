# ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Design Decisions

## Original Vision Summary

### Core Innovation
**drop** was conceived as a fundamental reimagining of habit tracking:
- **Identity Practice**: Focus on *who you become* vs. *what you achieve*
- **Quarterly Rhythm**: 90-day commitments resist frequent changes
- **Resource Allocation**: Smart distribution of limited time/energy
- **Minimal Friction**: Daily logging in seconds, not minutes

### Resource Model Breakthrough
The insight that different life domains need different tracking approaches:
- **Sleep** = Identity embodiment (wake/sleep rhythm)
- **Fitness** = Resource allocation (time/energy management)
- **Reading/Writing** = Tiered practice (flexible frequency)
- **Meditation** = Instance tracking (presence over perfection)
- **Burnout** = State awareness (1-5 scale, no targets)

### Design Philosophy
- **â‰¤15 words per screen** â€” every word costs attention
- **Graphics-first UI** â€” bars, waves, rings over text
- **One action per card** â€” clear, focused interactions
- **Domain colors** â€” Sleep=blue, Fitness=red, Mind=yellow, Spirit=green

### Technical Vision
- **Browser-native** â€” no build tools, open HTML directly
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€” modular, maintainable architecture
- **LocalStorage** â€” privacy-first, offline-capable
- **Mobile-first** â€” Pixel 8 baseline, touch-optimized

### User Experience Insights
- **Quarterly reset ritual** â€” meaningful transition ceremonies
- **Daily presence logging** â€” minimal friction, maximum consistency
- **Adaptive reflection** â€” visuals that match user style
- **Burnout awareness** â€” trend tracking, not optimization

### Success Metrics
- **Daily engagement** through frictionless design
- **Quarterly completion** through sustainable commitments
- **Identity formation** through consistent practice
- **Reflection depth** through adaptive visuals

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status (September 2025)
- âœ… **Core prototype** with full quarterly cycle
- âœ… **Resource model** implementation
- âœ… **Mobile-first** responsive design
- âœ… **Browser-native** architecture
- ðŸ”„ **Enhanced onboarding** with button-based selections
- ðŸ”„ **UX polish** and visual feedback improvements

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Modular JS architecture** (config, state, logic, ui, main)
- **Tailwind CSS via CDN** (no build process)
- **LocalStorage persistence** (privacy, offline-first)
- **Touch-optimized interactions** (tap, swipe, hold)
- **Semantic HTML** (accessibility, maintainability)

### Future Considerations
- **Over-allocation warnings** (prevent burnout)
- **Personality-driven onboarding** (adaptive onboarding; formerly explored as OCEAN integration)
- **Reflection export** (Markdown, sharing)
- **Advanced analytics** (trends, insights)
