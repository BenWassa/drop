## 📋 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Quick wins that improve user experience
2. **Test thoroughly** - Manual testing on multiple devices/browsers
3. **Document changes** - Update this document as features are completed
4. **Version control** - Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### **Code Standards**
- **Modular approach**: Keep features contained within appropriate modules
- **Mobile-first**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just emulators
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Performance conscious**: Minimize DOM manipulation and bundle size

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- [ ] **Touch interactions** (tap, swipe, long-press)
- [ ] **Offline functionality** (localStorage persistence)
- [ ] **Data integrity** (state persistence across sessions)

## 📝 **Document Management Best Practice**

### **Single Document Approach** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Pros**: Complete project visibility, easy tracking, single source of truth
- **Cons**: Can become long, requires good organization
- **Strategy**: Use collapsible sections, clear categorization, regular cleanup

### **Document Lifecycle**
1. **Active Development**: Keep in `docs/` folder as working document
2. **Feature Complete**: Move to `docs/archive/` with date stamp when major phases complete
3. **Historical Reference**: Archived versions serve as project history

### **Maintenance Schedule**
- **Weekly**: Update progress on active tasks
- **Monthly**: Review and reprioritize roadmap
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed phases, plan next quarter
