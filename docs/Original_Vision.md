# ðŸŒŠ Original Vision & Thoughts â€” drop

## Core Philosophy & Mission

**drop** reimagines habit tracking as **identity practice over time**. Instead of chasing arbitrary goals, users commit to quarterly archetypes (â‰ˆ90 days) and log daily presence with minimal friction, creating durable identity through consistent small actions.

### Foundational Principles

- **Quarterly commitments** â†’ Resistance to frequent switching, focus on identity formation
- **Minimal friction logging** â†’ Fast, intuitive interactions (tap, slider, vibe)
- **Identity over achievement** â†’ Small actions compound into meaningful personal change
- **Mobile-first design** â†’ Touch-optimized, responsive, offline-capable
- **Resource allocation model** â†’ Smart distribution of time/energy across life domains

## The Resource Model

### 1. Sleep = Identity Practice
- **Always one archetype (identity)**, not a "habit to build"
- **Defined by wake/sleep anchors**: 5:30/9:30, 6:30/10:30, 7:30/11:30
- **Daily identity embodiment**, no "times per week" metrics
- **Quarter-long commitment** to a specific rhythm

### 2. Fitness = Resource Allocation
- **Time/energy allocation** framed as resource management
- **Calculated from last week's performance** for sustainability
- **Core modes**: Maintain (steady), Deload (recovery), Growth (+10% progressive)
- **Example**: Last week 5km â†’ This week 5.5km (sustainable growth)

### 3. Reading & Writing = Tiered Practice
- **Archetypes remain valid** but flexible:
  - Reading: Leisure (light), Perspicacity (medium), Erudition (heavy)
  - Writing: Journal (light), Editorial (medium), Treatise (heavy)
- **Tiered as times per week** (2, 5, 8 sessions) â€” not rigid quotas
- **Flexible allocations** based on capacity and goals

### 4. Meditation = Tracked Practice
- **Archetypes**: Awareness, Introspection, Transcendence
- **Tracked as instances only** â€” no enforced frequency
- **Resource choice**, not performance metric
- **Presence over perfection**

### 5. Burnout = State Awareness
- **State tracker only** (1-5 scale: low stress to high strain)
- **No targets** â€” pure awareness tool
- **Visualized as trend/heatmap** in gratitude section
- **Important nuance**: High burnout can be necessary (hard training, deadlines)

## User Experience Philosophy

### Quarterly Reset (Vision)
1. **Path Selection**: Direct Control, Archetypes, or Growth Mode
2. **Resource Allocation**: Smart distribution across domains
3. **Confirmation Ritual**: "You are stepping into Earlybird + Perspicacity this quarter"

### Daily Presence (Practice)
- **Sleep**: Display chosen rhythm as identity embodiment
- **Fitness**: Show allocation + mode (Maintain/Deload/Growth)
- **Reading/Writing**: Archetypes + session tracking
- **Meditation**: Instance logging, no pressure
- **Burnout**: Daily state check-in (1-5 scale)

### Reflection (Gratitude)
- **Adaptive visuals** per user style (Direct/Archetype/Growth)
- **Burnout as trend/heatmap**, not a goal to optimize
- **Offline-first prompts**: "What deepened this week?"
- **Quarterly closure ritual** for transition

## Design Principles

### Information Architecture
- **â‰¤15 words per screen** â€” minimal, focused messaging
- **Graphics-first UI** â€” bars, waves, rings, fills over text
- **One action per card** â€” tap, swipe, or hold
- **Domain color coding**: Sleep=blue, Fitness=red, Mind=yellow, Spirit=green

### Interaction Design
- **Tap** = add instance / confirm
- **Swipe/drag** = vibe or duration input
- **Press & hold** = intensity fill
- **Feedback**: subtle glow, ripple, streak, wave animations

### Visual Language
- **Drop metaphor**: Small drops creating lasting change
- **Identity embodiment**: Being vs. doing
- **Resource allocation**: Smart distribution, not optimization
- **Sustainable growth**: Progressive improvement over time

## Technical Vision

### Browser-Native Application
- **No build tools required** â€” open `index.html` directly
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€” modular, maintainable architecture
- **LocalStorage persistence** â€” privacy-first, offline-capable
- **Mobile-first responsive** â€” Pixel 8 baseline, touch-optimized

### Architecture Goals
- **Clean separation of concerns** across 5 modules
- **Developer-friendly** â€” easy to understand and extend
- **Performance-first** â€” fast loading, smooth interactions
- **Accessibility** â€” large tap targets, semantic HTML

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Daily engagement** through minimal friction
- **Quarterly completion** through sustainable commitments
- **Identity formation** through consistent practice
- **Reflection depth** through adaptive visuals

### Technical Excellence
- **Zero build dependencies** â€” truly browser-native
- **Cross-browser compatibility** â€” works everywhere
- **Performance optimization** â€” smooth on mobile devices
- **Data persistence** â€” reliable localStorage integration

## Key Insights & Learnings

### Original Thoughts (September 2025)
- **Identity over goals**: Focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve
- **Resource allocation**: Smart distribution of limited time/energy across life domains
- **Minimal friction**: Daily logging should take seconds, not minutes
- **Quarterly rhythm**: 90-day cycles create resistance to frequent changes
- **Offline-first**: No backend dependency, complete user control
- **Mobile-native**: Designed for touch, optimized for phones

### Design Philosophy
- **Words are expensive**: Every word on screen costs user attention
- **Actions over options**: Clear, single-purpose interactions
- **Identity embodiment**: Daily practice of chosen archetypes
- **Sustainable growth**: Progressive improvement, not optimization
- **Reflection over tracking**: Meaningful insights, not just data
