- [x] **Error Handling**
  - [x] Graceful handling of localStorage failures
  - [x] User-friendly error messages
  - [x] Recovery options for corrupted data

### **Phase 2: Feature Completion** (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

#### 2.1 **Archetype System**
- [ ] **Complete Archetype Path Implementation**
  - Pre-defined commitment combinations (Scholar, Athlete, etc.)
  - Archetype selection UI with descriptions
  - Automatic commitment population from archetype
  - User customization after archetype selection

- [ ] **Archetype Management**
  - Add/modify archetypes in config
  - Archetype preview before selection
  - Save custom archetypes for future use

#### 2.2 **Growth Mode Intelligence**
- [x] **Historical Analysis Engine**
  - [x] Analyze previous 3 weeks of logging patterns (21-day rolling average)
  - [x] Calculate realistic target adjustments with clamping (80-120% of baseline)
  - [x] Prevent wild swings in fitness targets
- [ ] **Smart Recommendations**
  - Reading level progression (Leisure → Perspicacity → Erudition)
  - Writing complexity advancement
  - Fitness target optimization

#### 2.3 **Advanced Features**
- [x] **Over-Allocation Warnings**
  - [x] Detect ambitious combinations (e.g., max reading + max writing)
  - [x] Show confirmation dialogs for challenging commitments
  - [x] Suggest more balanced alternatives

- [ ] **Settings Screen**
  - Mid-quarter commitment adjustments
  - Fitness baseline modifications
  - App preferences and configuration

### **Phase 3: Data & Export** (High Impact, Medium Effort)

#### 3.1 **Data Portability**
- [ ] **Export Functionality**
  - JSON export of all user data
  - CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
  - Backup reminders on Quarterly Review screen

- [ ] **Import Capabilities**
  - Restore from exported backups
  - Merge data from multiple sources
  - Conflict resolution for overlapping dates

#### 3.2 **Data Visualization**
- [ ] **Enhanced Analytics**
  - Quarterly trend analysis
  - Domain-specific progress tracking
  - Consistency scoring and insights

### **Phase 4: Architecture & Scale** (Low Impact, High Effort)

#### 4.1 **Code Quality**
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**
  - [x] Unit tests for quarter/date calculations (Vitest setup)
  - [x] Package.json with test scripts
  - [x] Test coverage for core business logic
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Bundle size analysis and optimization
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Load time improvements

#### 4.2 **Manual-Only Focus** (Current Decision)
- [x] **No Backend Integration**: Focus remains on manual tracking for privacy and simplicity
- [x] **Client-Side Only**: All data stored locally in browser localStorage
- [x] **Privacy-First**: No external data sharing or API dependencies

## 📋 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Start with Phase 1** - Quick wins that improve user experience
2. **Test thoroughly** - Manual testing on multiple devices/browsers
3. **Document changes** - Update this document as features are completed
4. **Version control** - Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### **Code Standards**
- **Modular approach**: Keep features contained within appropriate modules
- **Mobile-first**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just emulators
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Performance conscious**: Minimize DOM manipulation and bundle size

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- [ ] **Touch interactions** (tap, swipe, long-press)
- [ ] **Offline functionality** (localStorage persistence)
- [ ] **Data integrity** (state persistence across sessions)

## 📝 **Document Management Best Practice**

### **Single Document Approach** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Pros**: Complete project visibility, easy tracking, single source of truth
- **Cons**: Can become long, requires good organization
- **Strategy**: Use collapsible sections, clear categorization, regular cleanup

### **Document Lifecycle**
1. **Active Development**: Keep in `docs/` folder as working document
2. **Feature Complete**: Move to `docs/archive/` with date stamp when major phases complete
3. **Historical Reference**: Archived versions serve as project history

### **Maintenance Schedule**
- **Weekly**: Update progress on active tasks
- **Monthly**: Review and reprioritize roadmap
- **Quarterly**: Archive completed phases, plan next quarter
